compile:

 ./autogen.sh --with-irssi=~/src/irssi-0.8.5.CVS
 make
 make user_install

load in irssi:

 /LOAD icq
 /SERVER -icqnet icq login.icq.com 5190 your_pass your_uin

If that works you can put that things in your config file.
Add to chatnets section:

 icqnet = { type = "ICQ"; nick = "your_uin"; };

and this to servers section

 { address = "login.icq.com"; chatnet = "icqnet"; port = "5190"; password = "your_pass"; }

Now you should be able to connect by simply writing

 /LOAD icq
 /CONNECT icqnet

and to load your buddies add this to settings section:

 "icq/core" = { buddy_file = "~/.micqrc"; };

Substitute ~/.micqrc with the path to your buddy file.
This plugin can read any file and looks for lines with an uin in the
first column and the nickname in the second column. The file is
loaded only once when the module is loaded.

Commands:

Future:
~~~~~~~
Because of the ugliness of AIM Oscar protocol I will not continue on this work.
If you want to take over development you are more than welcome to.
Among things left to do is:
 * Retrival of offline messages
 * Autoresponding away message
 * Clean up code :)
